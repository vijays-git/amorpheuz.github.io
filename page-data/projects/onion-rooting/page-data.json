There is a smokescreen here that lies over here. Middlemen keep crops in deep freezers and release them at a high rate when demand rises. We eradicate this problem with the help of a Blockchain network and an all transparent transaction that can be monitored and stop illegal storages of vegetables/crops.

In order to solve this problem, we contacted Matic Team and we were constantly in touch with them and they helped us a lot in solving our doubts. We spent around 10 hours on design thinking and understanding Blockchain ecosystem. This resulted in time constraints and it was challenging to complete our idea in the rest of the time.
